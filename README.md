# annotation-verification-lib
Provides different annotations that refer to the codes of conduct of the value range of declared class fields.

---

Adds several annotations to validate different class field content like the minimum value or the length of an array. Use those annotations to restrict the input possibilities similar to assertions.

Featured *class field* annotations included are listed below:

- @Interval(max, min)
- @Max(max)
- @Min(min)
- @NotNull
- @MaxSize(maxSize)
- @MinSize(minSize)

### Evaluation
This package also includes test cases to prove reliability of the related annotations.
