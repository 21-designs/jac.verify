Use those annotations to restrict the input possibilities similar to assertions.\r\n\r\nFeatured *class field* annotations included are listed below:\r\n\r\n- @Interval(max, min)\r\n- @Max(max)\r\n- @Min(min)\r\n- @NotNull\r\n- @MaxSize(maxSize)\r\n- @MinSize(minSize)\r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\nThis package also includes test cases to prove reliability of the related annotations. \r\n",
