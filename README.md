Several annotations to validate different class field content like the minimum value or the length of an array. Use those annotations to restrict the input possibilities similar to assertions.

Featured *class field* annotations included are listed below:

- @Interval(max, min)
- @Max(max)
- @Min(min)
- @NotNull
- @MaxSize(maxSize)
- @MinSize(minSize)

# Test Cases
This package also includes test cases to prove reliability of the related annotations.
